# The Y Programming Language

Copyright (C) 2013 Yin Wang. All rights reserved.

The Y Programming Language is designed to be a private language for Yin Wang
(thus the name). Although built on cutting-edge technologies, it is NOT allowed
to be used by anybody else except Yin, either commercially or not. Nor is Yin
responsible for the language's design, implementation quality or features. This
language is designed to satsify nobody but Yin's needs. It will not be
influenced nor controlled by any external force. Yin reserves the rights to
change the language, at any time and in any way he likes that may break any
existing code. It will not be guaranteed to be portable and may only work on
Yin's computer. Although the code is opensource, it is fully copyrighted and
non-free. You will be charged by enormous amount if you use it for commercial
purposes.

Why Yin wants such a language? Because he wants it to be fun. Users destroy the
fun and popularity prevent the languages from improving. This includes some of
the highly-respected functional programming languages. They all suffer from
their marketing hypes and trying to become "mainstream". They don't see their
own shortcomings and once there are users, it becomes hard to fix their
problems. The Y Language completely prevents these from happening by allowing
only one person, its creator, to use it. You may understand this better by
looking at the following quote from Alan Perlis:

> "I think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep
> fun in computing. When it started out it was an awful lot of fun. Of course
> the paying customers got shafted every now and then and after a while we began
> to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were
> responsible for the successful error-free perfect use of these machines. I
> don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for stretching them setting them
> off in new directions and keeping fun in the house. I hope the ﬁeld of
> computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all I hope we don’t
> become missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible sales-men. The world has
> too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will
> learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands.
> What’s in your hands I think and hope is intelligence: the ability to see the
> machine as more than when you were ﬁrst led up to it that you can make it
> more." -- Alan J. Perlis
