# The Yin Programming Language


### Introduction

I got tired of waiting for people to design and implement a language I'd love
(and not just usable), so I started to implement my own. Based on my
multi-facetted knowledge of programming language research, I know this language
will be different, but I'm sure not everyone would like it. You are welcome to
follow my development of this language and learn from my experiences and design
decisions.



### Current state

The language is in a design stage, so please don't expect it to be usable right
now. Many design decisions are already made, but many still remain. If you want
to learn how to design and implement a language, this might be a good place to
look.


### Implemented features

- basic types (integers, floats, arrays, records)
- primitive operators (arithmetic)
- first-class functions (closures)
- type system and type checker
